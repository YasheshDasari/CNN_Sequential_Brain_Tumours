# Brain MRI image classification

Python application to classify brain MRI images using Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN). Frameworks used: TensorFlow, Keras. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection.

# Objective 

The objective of this project is to classify brain MRI images using a Sequential CNN model. This is a binary classification problem, and the training dataset consists of MRI images of healthy and tumorous brains.
